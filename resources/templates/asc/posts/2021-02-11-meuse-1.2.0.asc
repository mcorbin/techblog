I released today the version **1.2.0** of https://github.com/mcorbin/meuse[Meuse], your favorite Rust private registry for your crates.

== What's new

=== More security

Meuse needs some secrets in its https://meuse.mcorbin.fr/installation/configuration/[configuration file], for example the PostgreSQL database password, or your S3 credentials if you are using the S3 backend for your crates.

This release allows you to set a new `!secret` (or `!envsecret` to read a value from an environment variable) YAML tags for your secrets in the configuration file. +
This will indicate to Meuse that the value is a secret. If this value is leaked by mistake by the program (like printed somewhere), the secret will be replaced by a `<< cloaked >>` string.

You may think "but why would the secret be logged/printed at the first place" ? Meuse will indeed not do that, but a mistake or a bug can happen, so I recommand you to use these tags.

=== New/Better metrics

New metrics were added to Meuse, and some we renamed.

Today, Meuse exposes tons of metrics, for example:

- Internal metrics about the process, threads...
- HTTP requests duration and count per endpoint
- HTTP response count per endpoint/status code
- Metrics about the Git index (operations count and duration)
- Number of crates, crates versions, users and downloads for the registry

Everything is exposed on `/metrics`, in Prometheus format.

=== Bugfix

An user found https://github.com/mcorbin/meuse/issues/36[a bug] when uploading on Meuse crates with dependencies renamed. The issue is now solved.

== More information

You can find more information about Meuse on https://meuse.mcorbin.fr/[the project website], and the code is available on https://github.com/mcorbin/meuse[Github].
