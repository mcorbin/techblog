How to install Riemann ?

== Installing Riemann

Go to http://riemann.io/ and download Riemann for your platform.
You will also need a JDK (OpenJDK 8 for example).

== Configuring Riemann JVM

On `Debian`, takes a look at `/etc/default/riemann`.
On RHEL, it should be on `/etc/sysconfig/riemann`.

For this tutorial, you don't need to modify this file.

Riemann is just a jar, so that's it, you have installed Riemann :)
