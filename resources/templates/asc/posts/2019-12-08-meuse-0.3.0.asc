I've just released the version 0.3.0 of https://github.com/mcorbin/meuse[Meuse], an alternative registry for the Rust programming language. What's new in this release ?

=== Database migrations

Meuse will now automatically create its database, and apply migration scripts when it starts. No need to execute SQL scripts manually anymore !

=== A frontend

I've created a frontend for Meuse. The frontend is very limited (you can only browse crates and categories, there is no authentication etc...) but I plan to improve it in the future. You can disable it in the configuration if you want.

=== Download count

Meuse now counts the number of times that a a crate is downloaded, per version. The number is returned by the API when you retrieve informations about crates, and is also available in the frontend.

=== A new call to retrieve statistics

The URL `api/v1/meuse/statistics` now returns the number of crates, crates versions, users and the total number of downloads.

=== Refactoring and enhancement

I did some internal refactorings on the database layer and on error handling. I also added new metrics.

== Conclusion

I will now write a CLI for the project (`curl` works well, but I want to have something better).

I would also like to improve the frontend, but I'm a very bad frontend developer (and I do not really like it). If you want to contribute, please ping me (by email or by creating issues on the https://github.com/mcorbin/meuse[Github repository]). The frontend is generated by the server, so the work should be mostly HTML, CSS and javascript.
