I released yesterday the version **1.1.0** of https://github.com/mcorbin/meuse[Meuse], your favorite Rust private registry.

== What's new

=== Tokens

A new page was added to the frontend and displays the list of the tokens for the connected user.

=== crates.io caching

As described in the documentation, Meuse is already able to https://meuse.mcorbin.fr/installation/mirroring/[mirror crates.io]. When crates are downloaded from crates.io, they are automatically cached on the Meuse store (which could be on the filesystem or on S3).

This release adds https://meuse.mcorbin.fr/api/mirror/[a new API call] to cache crates from crates.io. Like that, you can prefill your local crates.io cache if needed.

=== More info

You can find more information about Meuse on https://meuse.mcorbin.fr/[the project website], and the code is available on https://github.com/mcorbin/meuse[Github].
