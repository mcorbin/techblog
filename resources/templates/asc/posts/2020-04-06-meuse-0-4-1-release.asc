I'm happy to announce the release `0.4.1` of Meuse. This release allows you to disable authentication for the frontend if you want to.

Since `0.4.0`, Meuse supports authentication for its read-only frontend. With this new release, a `public` flag can be set to `true` (default to `false`) to completely disable authentication for the frontend.

As always, the https://meuse.mcorbin.fr/installation/configuration/[documentation] has been updated.

I will now start working on a CLI (which will be written in Rust !) for the project. Stay tuned !
